Python syntax is simple and easy to read. It uses indentation instead of braces `{}` like Java or C.

Here are some **basic Python syntax examples**:

### 1. Print Statement

```python
print("Hello World")
```

### 2. Variable Declaration

```python
name = "Ashu"
age = 25
```

### 3. If Condition

```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("Eligible to vote")
```

### 4. If–Else

```python
num = 10

if num > 0:
    print("Positive")
else:
    print("Negative")
```

### 5. For Loop

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

### 6. While Loop

```python
i = 1

while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

### 7. Function

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello", name)

greet("Ashu")
```

### 8. List

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]
print(fruits[0])
```

### 9. Dictionary

```python
person = {
    "name": "Ashu",
    "age": 25
}

print(person["name"])
```

### 10. Class

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

p1 = Person("Ashu")
print(p1.name)
```

**Key Python Syntax Rules**

* No semicolon `;` required
* Uses **indentation** for blocks
* Case sensitive
* Simple and readable
---

**Indentation in Python** means **spaces at the beginning of a line to define a block of code**. Unlike many languages, Python **does not use `{ }` braces**. Instead, it uses indentation to show which statements belong together.

### Example

```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("Eligible to vote")
    print("You can apply for license")
```

Here the two `print()` lines are **indented**, so they belong to the `if` block.

### Incorrect Example

```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
print("Eligible to vote")
```

This will give an **IndentationError** because Python expects the code inside `if` to be indented.

### Indentation with Loop

```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
    print("Loop running")
```

Both lines run inside the loop because they are indented.

### Important Rules

* Python usually uses **4 spaces for indentation**.
* All lines in the same block must have **equal indentation**.
* Mixing **tabs and spaces** can cause errors.

### Short Definition (for notes / README)

**Indentation:** Spaces at the beginning of a line used to define code blocks in Python.**

A **variable in Python** is a name used to store a value in memory. You create a variable by assigning a value using the `=` operator.

**Example**

```python
name = "Ashu"
age = 25
price = 99.5
```

Here:

* `name` stores a string
* `age` stores an integer
* `price` stores a float

Python automatically decides the **data type**, so you don’t need to declare it like in Java or C.

**Using variables**

```python
name = "Ashu"
print(name)
```

**Multiple variables**

```python
a, b, c = 10, 20, 30
print(a, b, c)
```

**Change variable value**

```python
x = 5
x = 10
print(x)
```

**Rules for variable names**

* Must start with a **letter or underscore**
* Cannot start with a **number**
* Cannot use **Python keywords** (`if`, `for`, `class`, etc.)
* Case sensitive (`name` and `Name` are different)

**Examples of valid variables**

```
name
_age
total_price
```

**Short definition :A variable is a container used to store data values in Python.**

**Basic operators in Python** are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.

### 1. Arithmetic Operators

Used for mathematical calculations.

```python
a = 10
b = 5

print(a + b)   # Addition
print(a - b)   # Subtraction
print(a * b)   # Multiplication
print(a / b)   # Division
print(a % b)   # Modulus (remainder)
print(a ** b)  # Power
print(a // b)  # Floor division
```

### 2. Comparison Operators

Used to compare two values. The result is **True or False**.

```python
a = 10
b = 5

print(a == b)  # Equal
print(a != b)  # Not equal
print(a > b)   # Greater than
print(a < b)   # Less than
print(a >= b)  # Greater or equal
print(a <= b)  # Less or equal
```

### 3. Logical Operators

Used to combine conditions.

```python
x = 10

print(x > 5 and x < 20)  # True if both conditions are true
print(x > 5 or x < 5)    # True if one condition is true
print(not(x > 5))        # Reverse the result
```

### 4. Assignment Operators

Used to assign values to variables.

```python
x = 10
x += 5   # x = x + 5
x -= 3   # x = x - 3
x *= 2   # x = x * 2
x /= 2   # x = x / 2
```

### Short version (good for notes / README)

* **Arithmetic:** `+  -  *  /  %  **  //`
* **Comparison:** `==  !=  >  <  >=  <=`
* **Logical:** `and  or  not`
* **Assignment:** `=  +=  -=  *=  /=`
